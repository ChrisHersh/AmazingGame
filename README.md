Updates will mainly be at ChrisHersh.com

Simple game made in Java using LibGDX, based off of the Fire Emblem series from Nintendo.

For those who do not know how LibGDX works, as of right now all of the code that would need to be changed is in /core 
the other folders are to run the application in different enviroments (iOS, Android, HTML, and Desktop)

If you want to help or have questions please send me an email at ch5968@cs.ship.edu. 
If you find or have any issues/bugs with the game please use the issue tracker.
And finally if you have modified this project and want me to add your changes to the main project please make a pull request

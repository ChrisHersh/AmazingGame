Create an Enum for the unit types and the tile types
	easier to save to txt file, just check the enum and remake the objects
	
For map generation, start with 100% of one tile (map type) and place new structures from there
	Add a setting for higher/lower amounts of modification to the map type
	
Difficulties, easy 10 vs 8, normal 10 vs 10, hard 8 vs 10, very hard 4 vs 10, HOW_IS_THIS_EVEN_WINNABLE 1 vs 10
	default to normal
	
	
	
Other game ideas~
